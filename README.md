The application is a React-based web platform that produces a professional online resume. It employs a component-driven architecture, where the Resume component in Resume.js organizes the content into sections such as a header containing personal information, education, and projects. The data is included within the component and stylized with Resume.css, which delineates the layout and visual aesthetics employing responsive design principles. The applicationâ€™s entry point, App.js, incorporates the Resume component to dynamically render the entire webpage. The input consists of predetermined data within the code, which can be modified as required. The procedure utilizes React's effective Virtual DOM to render and update components effortlessly. The result is a refined, responsive webpage that presents the user's information and project links in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Users can access external project repositories through clickable links, rendering the resume interactive and functional for online portfolios.
